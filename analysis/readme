Files
- bantu-map-visualisation: this script maps the bantu phylogeny onto Africa to determin the geographical location of ancestral nodes. this was used in exploration of the savannah hypothesis
- bantu_node70.R: exploring the bayestrait output of the reconstruction of node 70 in the bantu tree under the cross-cous marriage and iroquois hypothesis. 
- coevo-helper.R: helper functions for the analysis of the co-evolutionary output and visualisation
- coevo-settings: the settings used in bayestraits for the co-evolutionary models 
- mantel-functions: functions to run the mantel tests and summarize output
- signal-functions: functions to run the d-statistic test
- signal-tests: script to run all signal tests (mantel, partial mantel, and d-statistic)
- transition-rates.R: this script takes the transition-rate information from the bayestraits files and calculates their importance based on the criteria of them persisting in 95% of models.
