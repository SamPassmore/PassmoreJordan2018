	abstract = {Four disciplines—cultural anthropology, sociology, behavioristic psychology, and psychoanalysis—are synthesized utilizing the research technique of the Cross-cultural survey to study the family, kinship, and community organization of 250 human societies representative of all regions of the world and of all levels of civilization. It is shown that social organization in our society exhibits the same regularities and conforms to the same scientific principles as do comparable phenomena among other societies. The postulational method has been applied in this analysis and prediction of social phenomena. A technique of historical reconstruction is presented in an appendix. Extensive bibliography of ethnographic sources.},
