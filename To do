To do

- are transition rates changed to new anc-state?
- pmp results for new tree BL
- fossilized bantu for new tree BL
- guillon and mace replication completed?
- fossilized at node 70 results for bantu & CCM. 

- change BF results in text (currently in table 1 - highlighted terms indicate changes in 'significance')
	- this will also entail changing the structure of the text
- Change numbers on 'number of significant reults and across trees'
